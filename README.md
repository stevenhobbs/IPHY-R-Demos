# IPHY-R-Demos

### Created by Steven L. Hobbs

### Description and Purpose

The R Demo files in this repository are synced with the online resource [Data Essentials with R](URL) (DEWR), which was created to support the student and instructional needs of IPHY 3280 and 5800, undergraduate and graduate statistics courses in the Integrative Physiology Department of CU Boulder. These files contain the same content as DEWR but are organized into a student-friendly R project. Also, the content of DEWR is organized differently in this repository and exists as 5 quarto files, each of which is presented as an R demonstration during lecture periods.

3280/5800 enrolled students should fork this repository, set up local git repositories on their personal computers, and explore the code functionality. The 3280/5800 instructor team will continue to collaboratively update, expand, and improve this course resource, meaning students who continue with research and work in R will have a resource that evolves in pace with developments in R and best practices in data science.

Use of this content is open to the public and has no restrictions whatsoever.
